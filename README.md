🌤️ Simple Weather App
This is a simple weather web app I built using React and the Open-Meteo API. The goal was to practice working with APIs and managing state in React while keeping the UI clean and minimal.

🔧 Features
Shows weather data for 7 days (including temperature highs/lows and weather codes).

Fetches real-time forecast data using Axios.

Temperature toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
